# Text Editors

Last week, we used the default system text editors for writing code. These are useful tools, but when developing most code, they just don't cut it. Most programmers use specially designed coding editors, with features such as autocompletion, viewing every time you use a variable, or running your code without having to use the command line.

## Introducing: Microsoft VSCode
One editor used by many developers is Microsoft VSCode. This is arguably the most feature-filled code editor. It is downloadable for free, is rather small in size, and can be upgraded with extensions that add new features. I will be doing the next lesson on how to use some of the many features.

## Introducing: Sublime Text
Sublime Text is a more minimal text editor, with a smaller set of features. It is easier to learn but requires running code on the command line.

## Your Choice
So for now, you can choose what code editor you want. You can stick with the default text editor we used the last lesson, or use VSCode or Sublime. You can look at VSCode here, or Sublime here. Personally, I used Sublime until recently, but VSCode blew it out of the water. For now, any will work. 
Note: Their are also other editors with which I have no experience and also IDEs which integrate multiple features like running code in the window similar to editors. Feel free to search "Code editor" and use whatever you feel is best.

## Assignment: 
Choose a text editor, download and install. 


Good day all, and let's get coding!
