# Hello all!
As explained in my last lesson, text editors provide useful features specifically for developers. The most popular editor is released by Microsoft and is called VSCode. If you are going to use VSCode, you should already have it installed (if you still need to download it, this is the link). If not, this email will outline some useful features your editor may have. 
## Opening Your Editor
Opening a file in VSCode is simple: use the open file option in the file menu (found on the bar at the top of the screen). Even better, most editors have a folder open option. This lets you work with any file in an application, by using a navbar instead of the open file window. To use this, go to the file menu and click open folder. navigate to and select the folder to open (in this case you will want Desktop/Coding/Ruby or wherever you saved your files).

You can also open VSCode from the command line. Just run the command `code`. If, as is more likely, you need to open a file, navigate to the folder containing your file and run `code filename.rb`.  To open a folder, navigate into it and run `code .`. Note: The dot is very important; it stands for the current directory.

## Adding Extensions
One of the best things about VSCode is that it allows users to create extensions and let other users install them. To look at the available extensions, go to the sidebar on the left and select the button at the bottom, with a box inside another (broken?) box. Search `ruby`. Each extension from the list provides some new feature. Install the Ruby extension to provide basic Ruby support. Look through the other extensions and install any you feel would be useful.

## Editing
To use a code editor, you type exactly the same code you would use for IRB. You then save and run the file. Editors improve on basic text editors by adding things such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion. For example, the basic ruby extension automatically colors data structures and conditionals purple, strings red, and functions yellow. As you type, autocompletion boxes will pop up. Use the up and down keys to select the thing you are typing and hit enter, and VSCode will complete the method.

## Running from the editor
Some editors allow you to run code directly from the editor. Press f5, then select Ruby from the menu. Your code will run, and also provide info on the session. 
You can also open a terminal by pressing Ctrl-Shift-P and searching "terminal". You can also use that command to search for any function you want VSCode to do.

## Assignment: 
Look at your editor, play around, type a few lines of code, and just generally get acquainted with it.

Good job all, and let's get coding!
