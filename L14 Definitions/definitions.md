# Definitions

## Hello all!
When I started this course, I knew that you wanted to program, not talk about programming. However, if you are ever going to tell someone about your code, you will need to know some basic terms.

## Your Coding Vernacular (What's that?)
Apologies on the big words! A vernacular is the set of words and expressions that distinguish the way you speak and the words you know and use. The way you speak and the words you use to speak it. 

Now that you can understand this heading, let's dive into content with some definitions, courtesy of hackr.io

* Program: A computer program is termed as an organized collection of instructions, which when executed perform a specific task or function.
* A program is processed by the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer before it is executed. An example of a program is Microsoft Word, which is a word processing application that enables users to create and edit documents. The browsers that we use are also programs created to help us browse the internet.
* Argument: Argument or arg is a value that is passed into a command or a function. For example, if `SQR` is a routine or function that returns the square of a number, then `SQR(4)` will return 16. Here, the value 4 is the argument. Similarly, if edit is a function that edits a file, then in `edit myfile.txt`, `‘myfile.txt’` is the argument.
* Booleans or Conditionals: A Boolean expression or Boolean logic is an expression used for creating statements that are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Examples include `==`, `!=`, `>`, `and`, and etc. They are also called conditionals
* Bug: A bug is a general term used to denote an unexpected error or defect in hardware or software, which causes it to malfunction. You will spend a lot of time debugging, removing bugs from your code, at all levels of programming.
* Code: Code or source code is a term used to describe a written set of instructions. The code can also be used informally to describe text written in a specific programming language.
* Command line interface: Command line interface is a user interface(a way to communicate between user and computer) based on text. During the early 1960s and through the 1970s and 1980s, the command line interface was the primary means of interaction with most computers on terminals.
* Constants: A constant is a term used to describe a value that does not change throughout the execution of the program, unlike a variable. In Ruby, a constant is marked by an initial capital letter in names such as `Pi`, `MyUser`, and `HelloWorld`, and Ruby will warn you if you try to change one.
* Data types: A data type is the classification of a particular type of data. We as humans can understand the difference between a name and a number, but the computer cannot. The computer uses special internal codes to distinguish between different types of data it receives and processes.
* Exception: A special, unexpected and anomalous condition encountered during the execution of a program is known as an exception. It can also be termed as an error or a condition which alters the way of the program or the microprocessor to a different path. An example of an exception can be the case when a program tries to load a file from the disk, but the file does not exist. The exceptions must be handled and eradicated in the program code to avoid any fatal error.
* Nil: Nil (`nil`) defines the lack of any value whatsoever.
* Statement: In programming, a statement is a single line of code written legally in a programming language that expresses an action to be carried out. A statement might have internal components of its own, including expressions, operators and functions. An example of a statement is `A = A + 5`. A program is nothing but a sequence of one or multiple statements.
* Syntax: Similar to human languages, programming languages have their own set of rules on how statements can be conveyed. The set of these rules is known as syntax. While a number of programming languages share many features, functions, and capabilities, they differ in syntax. Without the proper use of the syntax, one cannot write an executable program, and a wrong syntax will lead to a plethora of errors.

Wheew! Did you get all that? Right now it probably seems very complicated, and that's because it is. There is a reason computers have only existed for 50-so years. 
Good day all, and let's get coding! Next up: Errors and how to deal with them.
