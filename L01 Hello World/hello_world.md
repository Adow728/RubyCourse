# Ruby: Hello World

## Hello!

Today we will cover the first lesson learned in all languages: to print "Hello World!" on the command prompt. In Ruby, this process is extremely simple. The line of code reads:

```ruby
001: puts "Hello World!"
```

Which outputs:

```terminal
Hello World
=> nil
```

The `puts` command is very simple: it outputs the following to output (for you, this will be the IRB interface). The `"Hello World!"` part is also simple. It is a string, which is a bunch of keyboard characters joined together to make a word, sentence or maybe even `"thklxjsocivdjvlw!@@?"`! The puts command also generates no return, hence the => nil.

## Assignment: 
Just mess around with the above program. What can you change without causing an error? Can you make it say your name?

Good day, and let's get coding! Next up: Variables
