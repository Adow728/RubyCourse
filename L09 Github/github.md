# Hello all!
Last lesson we learned about Git, a version control system. This lesson we will learn about sharing your code with using, can you guess? **Git!** Now I know you are probably thinking, "*Git*? I don't understand! Well, Git supports pushing your code to websites that are engineered for that purpose. Enter stage left: **Github**

## Introducing: Github

Github is a code repository holding website. It allows you to share your code with the world, and to work with a partner via the internet. To use Github, you must sign up. Once you sign up, however, you are allowed an infinite number of repositories, including code sharing, basic web hosting, and more! 
Many websites that require accounts can also be connected with Github, so you only require one login for all your sites.

## Find Me!

Most serious developers use Github to store their code. I personally have multiple repositories at https://github.com/Adow728.

## Assignment: 
Look at [Github](www.github.com). I recommend signing up but it is not necessary. If you do sign up, create a practice repository and also learn how to push from the command line. Also, you will have to create an SSH key to facilitate the transfer between your computer and Github. Read and complete [this site](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/your-first-rails-application) steps 1.3 and 1.4. 
If you want, we will be learning about everything on the page so you can attempt it all. If you try it on Windows, Rails is very argumentative so please email me and I will help.

Good Day all, and let's get coding!
