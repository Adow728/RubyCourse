# Booleans
Is 3 equal to 2? Is 4 < 5? Are 7 and 3 equal to 10? All of these are yes/no questions. 

## Boolie-whats?
Booleans(boo-lee-anns) are very simple. There are only two possible boolean values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are used in most type of ruby blocks, such as `if`, `while`, and others. 

### Statements
A boolean statement is basically a question. Is my_var equal to 4? Is there an "N" in my word? There are multiple simple statements that return booleans.

* `x == y` True if x is equal to y
* `x > y` True if x is more than y
* `x < y` True if x is less than y
* `x != y` True if x is different than y
* `x >= y` True if x is more than or equal to y
* `x <= y` True if x is less than or equal to y
* `not` True if the following boolean is false

A boolean object (The values true or false) can be printed to the command line with `puts`, and use the `.to_s` command for concatenation

For an example of booleans
```
001: puts 5 == 5
=> true
```

## Assignment
```ruby
Assignment == "Compare any two values with a boolean
and print the result to the screen.
Also, write a program that compares something about you and 
concatenate the result with another string."
=> true
```
Good Day all, and let's get coding!
